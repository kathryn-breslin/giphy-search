# Giphy Search
An application to search the Giphy API

This application uses JavaScript, specifically jQuery, to call and return the Giphy API. 

This specific repo was used to practice building, and then explaining, core jQuery concepts to students throughout my time as a TA at the University of Pennsylvania's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.
